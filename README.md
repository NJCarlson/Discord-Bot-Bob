Bob the discord bot is outdated, as Discord APIs have changed, and heroku ended their free subscription level. 


# BobBot
Discord bot project, made to learn Node / discord.js and Heroku

Various commands include :
		 
!help - list of commands.

!ping  - Returns "Pong" message to verify BobBot is listening. 

!cat - BobBot finds you a picture of a cat from https://aws.random.cat/meow

!urban [Search term] - Returns a definition from Urban Dictionary.

!insult - Returns a unique insult generated by BobBot's proprietary Insult Engine. 

!weather [Search Location] - Experimental, returns weather from openweathermap api.

!spam [message] - BobBot sends the message 5 times, can only send the !insult message, requires permission.

Note, may need to obtain a new bot token from Discord, since the one in this repo was changed when uploaded.
